# Random Name Generator

This rails app is intended to function as a random name generator. It will pull in a combination of [1990][] and [2000][] US Census data using publicly available .csv files and then generate names to user's specifications.

Options should eventually include:

* Male vs. Female names
* Common vs. Unusual names
