# Random Name Generator

This rails app is intended to function as a random name generator. It will pull in a combination of [1990][] and [2000][] US Census data using publicly available files and then generate names to the user's specifications.

Options should eventually include:

* Male vs. Female names
* Common vs. Unusual names
* Names based on frequency within different racial/cultural groups (White, Black, Asian Pacific Islander, Native American, Hispanic)
